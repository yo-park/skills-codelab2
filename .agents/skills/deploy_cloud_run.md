# Skill: Deploy to Cloud Run

## Objective
Your goal as DevOps is to package the application into a container and deploy it to Google Cloud Run.

## Instructions
1. **Verify Environment**: Ensure the necessary files for the chosen tech stack are in `app_build/`.
2. **Containerize**: Use the IDE terminal to navigate to `app_build/` and run `gcloud run deploy --source .`. 
3. **Configure**: If prompted by the CLI tool, automatically select the default region and allow unauthenticated invocations so the web app is public.
4. **Report**: Output the live production Google Cloud Run URL to the user!
